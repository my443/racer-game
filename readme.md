# Racer - A Classic Racing Game

When I was in gradeschool I always wanted to program in C. I would go to the library and check out the book **C Programming Guide** by Jack J. Purdum. I would longingly look at the instructions on printf and scanf. And then I would sigh and realize once again that I didn't have a C compiler. I don't know if there was a C compiler for the Commodore 64, and I had access to a Pascal and Fortran compiler on our XT. But no C compiler.   

Over the years I've deployed production apps in lots of C-like languages (Javascript, Java, PHP, and even a little C#.) Writing this game is my weekend project to make a childhood dream come true. I can now say that I have programmed something of interest in C. 

I hope you enjoy this classic racing game.

It was compiled using [Tiny C Compiler](https://bellard.org/tcc/) on a Windows machine. 
For those of you who want to run this on Windows, you can go to the bin folder and run the exe. 

## To Run This Game

* Compile first.c with a C compiler
* Run the executable.

## Why Is This Useful?

Aside from allowing me to achieve a childhood dream, this project is helpful in a number of ways. 
1. It gives me a quick and practical learning experience in C. C is still used everywhere. Most recently C is a big part of webassembly. Webassembly is an important piece in the evolution of the web. 
2. If someone else who is learning C wanted to look at this code for examples they will find simple, but practical, ways to use the code. 
3. If you wanted to use this as a starter for your own C learning you could. I've included some TODOs at the bottom of the main code (first.c) which could get you started.
